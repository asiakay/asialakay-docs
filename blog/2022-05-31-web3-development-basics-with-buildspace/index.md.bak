‚úçÔ∏è writing custom smart contracts
üí∞ building a "connect wallet" flow
üöÄ deploying to Ethereum (Polygon? Algorand? Solana?)

Let's do this!

<!--truncate-->


### Get your local Ethereum networking running ###

1. We're going to write a smart contract.

2. Our smart contract will be deployed to the blockchain

3. We're going to build a client website



### ‚ú® The magic of Hardhat ### 
- lets us set up a local Ethereum Dev enviromnent
- provides test ETH for free dev testing 
- provides dummy accounts to work with 
- provides a vehicle for compiling smart contracts quickly for test deployment to a blockchain

The difference between blockchains and develoment servers are that blockchains are public record.  

Requirements to run Hardhat
- node/npm: checked to make sure node was installed by running the command `node -v` in VSCode's integrated CLI terminal. This command returned v16.15.0, the version that is currently installed. 

```Bash
(base) @mbp asialakay-docs %node -v
v16.15.0
```
If not installed or command not found, find [instructions for installing node.js here](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/setting-up-the-environment). Also, for newer releases of the node.js runtime, click here
